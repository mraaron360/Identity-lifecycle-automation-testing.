# 🔄 Identity Lifecycle Automation

This project automates **user onboarding and offboarding** from HR data into Okta/Azure AD.  
It simulates a real IAM engineer workflow — integrating HR → IAM → target apps.

## 🚀 Features
- Import users from CSV (`users.csv`)  
- Provision new accounts into Okta/Azure AD  
- Assign groups/roles based on department/job title  
- Offboard (disable & remove access) when users leave  
- Generate audit log (`audit_log.csv`)
